## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS custom properties, functions and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

-   The bigges learn was how to use CSS Grid. I would say I still have some more practice to do especially when it comes to making it responsive. I think I could have definitely optimized my solution but will look forward to any feedback I can grow from.

### Continued development

-   Continue working on responsive layouts
-   Practicing more using CSS grid

### Useful resources

-   [CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9G0Zh5DVA&t=670s) - This helped get a bit of a better understanding of CSS Grid.
-   [CSS Grid 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A more indepth look at CSS grid.
